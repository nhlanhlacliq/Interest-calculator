# Interest Calculator

For this task, the aim was to create a program that lets a user calculate interest on either an investment or a bond.

_The Program works as follows_
* User chooses between bond or investment (user allowed to enter capitilized input or the first three characters for speedier use)

Should the user choose the investment option :
      They enter the required details for the calculations, i.e., Deposit amount, interest rate, number of years and whether it is simple or compound interest.
      The program then returns the answer to the user in an easy to understand manner.
      
Should the user choose the bond option :
      They enter similar required details and the program prints out how much they will have to pay monthly for their bond.
